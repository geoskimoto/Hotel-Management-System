Features that are still needing logic and solutions for:

* Need to delete other hotels (after fig out how to show hotels again in admin dashboard), make homepage just about CSC,
    move booking page into dashboard after logging in, change "hotel" model to lodge (maybe able to do this with replace all? 
    although dangerous af)
            *NOTE!!!!!!!! 
                **The options in the admin sidebar are controlled in /hotel/admin.py file
                  in the last several lines eg. "admin.site.register(Hotel, HotelAdmin)"
* Need to get room type back in admin dashboard
* Need to be able to charge members for yearly memberships and meals
* Add a recent activity/message board to member dashboards and have the ability to create messages on the admin dashboard.
* Ability for multiple bunks to be booked on the same invoice and multiple members to be entered into invoice for each bunk...how current system is.
* Section on main page for Cascade Newsletter
* Change colors
* Add about us, etc htmls
* Fix stripe api keys and test.


Things you need a better understanding of:
* views - logic behind making the bookings
* urls - how to use class based url mapping like this app is using as we ll as SLUGS
* css, bootstrap familiarity
* what the admin.py file is doing
* stripe and paypal payments
