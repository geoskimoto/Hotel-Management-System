Features that are still needing logic and solutions for:

* Fixes and major updates to booking:
  - Need to have different rates for different members (primary, child, guest).
    * Don't think you need to actually link members together in the Profiles model.  Just need to have a field called 
      "children" and "guests" and have them editable by the User.  Then in the Booking model have ability to add
       children/guests to the booking, which means in the RoomType model you'll need to have different rates for 
       different groups.
  - Ability to set all bunks the same price instead of having to go through all ~90 of them. 
  - Move all booking functionality to a separate python module and import into views.
  - Fix stripe api keys and test.  Add google and apple wallets/checkouts.

* Create models, logic, html pages to make one time purchases for yearly memberships, meals, and events.  Use the club's current
  squarespace site as a guide/template.
* Add PublicNews and MemberNews divs/message boards to index.html and user.
* sqlite has a lock where only a single user/session can write at a time.  Might have to switch over to mysql.
* Add about us, etc htmls
* Change "hotel" model to lodge (maybe able to do this with replace all? although dangerous af)



* Handle 404 errors so it goes to defined 404 page instead of debug page.  Something like this:
  from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
  def hotel_detail(request, slug):
      hotel = get_object_or_404(Hotel, status="Live", slug=slug)
      # Your existing code for handling the hotel details


Things you need a better understanding of:

* views - logic behind making the bookings
* urls - how to use class based url mapping like this app is using as well as SLUGS
* SLUGS
* css, bootstrap familiarity
* what the admin.py file is doing
* stripe and paypal payments




Completed Tasks:

* Need to delete other hotels (after fig out how to show hotels again in admin dashboard), make homepage just about CSC,
    move booking page into dashboard after logging in
            *NOTE!!!!!!!!
                **The options in the admin sidebar are controlled in /hotel/admin.py file
                  in the last several lines eg. "admin.site.register(Hotel, HotelAdmin)"
* Need to get room type back in admin dashboard
* Change colors
* Membership application form
* Change name in tab from desphaxis to CSC and add club favicon
* Have only an exclusive list of emails that can sign-up.  Maybe hide sign-up page and make that something you send to
members once they are approved?
* Add new table with two new ckeditor fields; one for external and the other for internal news.
