Features that are still needing logic and solutions for:

* Need to be able to charge members for yearly memberships and meals
* Add a recent activity/message board to member dashboards and have the ability to create messages on the admin dashboard.
* Ability for multiple bunks to be booked on the same invoice and multiple members to be entered into invoice for each bunk...how current system is.
* Add new table with two new ckeditor fields; one for external and the other for internal news.  Then add external News
section to index and the internal News to section on the user dashboard
* Add about us, etc htmls
* Fix booking functionality.
* Fix stripe api keys and test.  Add google and apple wallets/checkouts.
* Change "hotel" model to lodge (maybe able to do this with replace all? although dangerous af)
* Have only an exclusive list of emails that can sign-up.  Maybe hide sign-up page and make that something you send to
members once they are approved?
* Membership application form
* Change name in tab from desphaxis to CSC and add club favicon



Things you need a better understanding of:

* views - logic behind making the bookings
* urls - how to use class based url mapping like this app is using as well as SLUGS
* SLUGS
* css, bootstrap familiarity
* what the admin.py file is doing
* stripe and paypal payments




Completed Tasks:

* Need to delete other hotels (after fig out how to show hotels again in admin dashboard), make homepage just about CSC,
    move booking page into dashboard after logging in
            *NOTE!!!!!!!!
                **The options in the admin sidebar are controlled in /hotel/admin.py file
                  in the last several lines eg. "admin.site.register(Hotel, HotelAdmin)"
* Need to get room type back in admin dashboard
* Change colors
