    <section id="invoices">
        <h3>Invoices - How to Pay using Credit Notes or using PayPal</h3>
        <p>There are two preferred ways to pay invoices: via Credit Notes or via Stripe.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Credit Notes:</strong> Use an open Credit Note (with a positive balance) to pay off invoices.</li>
            <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> You can pay invoices via Stripe.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can still pay by check or cash. However, during peak times at the lodge (usually from 4 â€“ 8 PM on weekends), the manager might be busy and unable to assist with payments.</p>
        <p>All open invoices must be paid before you can make a booking. Additionally, you need to maintain an overall positive balance. To check your financial status, click the Membership link. The page will show the financial status for each household member. If the status is FALSE, you cannot make a booking. Pay your open invoices first by clicking Financial >> Invoices for a list of your invoices.</p>
